# Smart-building

#This is a readme file on the feature extraction tasks from different multiple sensor data.
#There are six physical factors of a room collected and there are 16 different activies to be predicted. 
#A list of weather events is also added to the building dataset and there are 22 different featues in the input list.
#We applied the discretiationa and one-hot encoding on the input and we considered the prediction of six different physical featuers given the activity type.
#Afterwards, we applied linear regression, LASSO, Support Vector Regression, Gradient Boosted Regression Trees.
#For the classification, we applied Support Vector Machien, LSTM, feed-forwad DNN, and Hybrid DNN.
